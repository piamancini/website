          <h1>FAQ</h1>

          <h3>What is an Open Collective?</h3>
          <p>An Open Collective is a group of people who collects money to do something together in full transparency: Everyone who puts money in the collective can follow the money and see all the transactions.</p>

          <h3>What can I do with OpenCollective?</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Set up a page to collect membership fees or donations</li>
            <li>Let your members submit expenses and reimburse them with a click</li>
            <li>Give everyone visibility on your budget</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>If you have an organization, you can use OpenCollective to empower local chapters to raise money locally and have their own budget. See <a href="#organizations">OpenCollective For Organizations</a>.</em></p>

          <h3>What is OpenCollective good for?</h3>
          <p>OpenCollective is ideal for meetups, open source projects, parent associations, neighborhood associations, clubs, unions, movements, non-profits, business incubators, etc.</p>

          <h3>Why should I use OpenCollective?</h3>
          <p>Because you want to easily collect money online for a group and you want to give visibility to everyone involved on how the money collected will be used.</p>

          <h3>How is that different from KickStarter, IndieGogo or GoFundMe?</h3>
          <p>All those crowdfunding platforms are awesome to get money from the crowd for well defined products or for a "one-off" cause that is limited in time. OpenCollective on the other hand is meant to collect money from the crowd (or from members) to finance the activities of a group that has a well defined purpose.</p>
          <p>Because on OpenCollective backers don't expect to receive goods, we give them full visibility on how their money is being used by the collective. Their money doesn't go into a black box. Everyone who puts money in a collective can "follow the money".</p>

          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <p>When you create a collective, you connect it to your PayPal account. The money collected goes directly to your account. Whenever you –or a member of the collective– wants to use the money, they submit an expense via the mobile app. Once you approve it, the person who submitted the expense is automatically reimbursed on their personal PayPal account.
            The budget and all the expenses are visible to everyone who put money in the collective.</p>

            <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
            <p>We are currently in private beta. Contact us for pricing details. </p>

            <h3>Is OpenCollective available in my country?</h3>
            <p>Right now, only US based organizations and individuals can create an open collective, but there is no restriction on members and donors.</p>
            <a name="organizations"></a>
            <p>But fear not, as soon as we figure things out here, we will very quickly expand to new territories based on where the demand is the highest (<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40OpenCollect%20Hey%20please%20hurry%20to%20open%20your%20service%20in%20[fill%20the%20blank]" target="_blank">so let us know!</a>).</p>

            <h3>What is OpenCollective For Organizations?</h3>
            <p>OpenCollective For Organizations lets you empower local chapters to raise money and have their own budget without having to create a legal entity and a bank account. No more asking a local sponsor to directly pay for the pizzas!</p>

            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <p>OpenCollective sits on top of the PayPal account of your organization. It creates virtual groups for each of your chapters. You can define the budget for each of them. You can also choose to let them have their own dedicated page to raise money locally to increase their budget (and optionally keep a percentage for the main organization). Legally speaking, this is the equivalent of acting as a "Fiscal Sponsor".</p>

            <h3>Why Do You Do What You Do? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=images&vertical=default&q=%23wdydwyd&src=typd" target="_blank">#wdydwyd</a></h3>
            <p>We want to empower people to create the organizations and institutions of tomorrow.</p>

            <p>After <a href="https://Storify.com">Storify</a> (my first startup in Silicon Valley), one of my options was to go back to Belgium (where I’m originally from) and start a new political party or a “union 2.0”. Why? Because 90%+ of the young people there don’t feel represented by existing political parties or unions (and I’m pretty sure it’s the same in your country). All those institutions were founded 100+ years ago at a time when paper was the only two-way communication channel. They lack feedback loops, they lack transparency and as a result, they are increasingly disconnected from their base. We need new institutions for this Internet era.</p>

            <p>I could spend the next 5-10 years of my life doing that. But that doesn't scale. Yet, this is a global issue. It's not limitd to Belgium. So I wondered: “How can I empower others to go build those political parties and unions of tomorrow?”; “What tools do people need to create those organizations?”.</p>

            <p>While the Internet has been really good so far at helping people get together and do things together, it has been quite bad at dealing with money. As a result, we’ve seen a lot of movements popping up here and there that ended up disappearing as quickly. The harsh reality of this world is that without money, you can’t sustain a group over time.</p>

            <p>The biggest notable exception is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podemos_%28Spanish_political_party%29#cite_note-GPnov2014-54">Podemos</a>, the new political party in Spain that started in 2014 and who quickly became the second largest political party just a year later. Their secret? They were able to get 285,000+ people to become members and pay a minimum of 5 euros (~$6) per month to finance and sustain the movement.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it’s still too complicated for a group to quickly collect money for their cause.</p>

            <p>I experienced it first hand when I lead the <a href="http://startupmanifesto.be">Startup Manifesto in Belgium</a>. A grassroots movement to come up with recommendations to the government to “make it suck less” for startups in Belgium. At some point, we wanted to print stickers for a conference but we didn’t have money. Plenty of people were willing to support our cause and make a donation. But in order to accept that money, we would have to create a bank account, which requires first to create a legal entity. We had better things to do. Not to mention that the money would have been collected in a black box where all supporters would have zero visibility. That was against our values. So we just gave up on the idea of collecting money. And <a href="https://twitter.com/xdamman/status/575744358592475136">an existing organization simply paid the stickers for us</a>.</p>

            <p>That’s why I’m building OpenCollective.<br />
              I want to empower people to do things together with money. I want to empower people to go build the organizations, movements, associations and institutions of tomorrow in a bottom-up fashion where transparency is built in by design.</p>
